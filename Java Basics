Note- Relationship Between Class and Interface
A class can extend another class and similarly, an interface can extend another interface. 
However, only a class can implement an interface and the reverse (an interface implementing a class) is not allowed.

✅ Definition of Interface in Java (Interview Style)
"An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a contract of methods that a class must implement.
It contains method signatures without implementations, and any class that implements the interface agrees to provide concrete behavior for those methods."

Or

🧾 Easy Definition of Interface
"An interface in Java is like a blueprint for a class. It tells what methods a class should have, but not how those methods work.
Any class that uses the interface must write the actual code for those methods."

🎯 Why Use Interfaces?
Helps in writing flexible and clean code.
Makes it easy to change or add new features.
Useful when different classes need to do similar things in their own way.
WebDriver Interface - RemoteWebDriver is fullyImplemented class extended by ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver class etc.

🔍 Key Points to Emphasize
No Method Bodies (Until Java 8+):

Traditionally, interfaces only had abstract methods.
Since Java 8, interfaces can have:
Default methods (with implementation)
Static methods
Private methods (Java 9+)


Multiple Inheritance:
Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes, but a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing flexible design.


Variables in Interfaces:
All variables are implicitly public static final — they act as constants.

Use Case:
Interfaces are ideal for defining capabilities or roles.

Polymorphism:
Interfaces enable polymorphic behavior. You can write code that works on the interface type, not the concrete class.

Interface - 
Defined as an abstract type.
Used to specify  or blueprint of a class
Contains static constants and abstract methods
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
By default, variables in an interface are public, static and final.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
It supports loose coupling (classes depend on behavior, not implementation).
In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
An interface in Java defines a set of behaviours that a class can implement, usually representing a CAN-DO relationship, but not always in every scenario.

To declare an interface, use the interface keyword. It is used to provide total abstraction. 
That means all the methods in an interface are declared with an empty body and are public and abstract 
and all fields are public, static and final by default.
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
To implement the interface, use the implements keyword.

A class can extend another class and similarly, an interface can extend another interface. 
However, only a class can implement an interface and the reverse (an interface implementing a class) is not allowed.

When to Use Class and Interface?
Use a Class when:

Use a class when you need to represent a real-world entity with attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
Use a class when you need to create objects that hold state and perform actions
Classes are used for defining templates for objects with specific functionality and properties.
Use a Interface when:

Use an interface when you need to define a contract for behavior that multiple classes can implement.
Interface is ideal for achieving abstraction and multiple inheritance.
Implementation: To implement an interface, we use the keyword implements

Let’s consider the example of Selenium WebDriver like ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver and SafariDriver share common functionalities, which can be defined in an interface, allowing each class (e.g., ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver and SafariDriver) to implement them in its own way. This approach ensures code reusability, scalability and consistency across different browser driver types.

Multiple Inheritance in Java Using Interface
Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity, but it supports multiple inheritance using interfaces.

class  implements Interface,Interface
Interface extends Interface,Interface

Note: In Java, the abstract keyword applies only to classes and methods, indicating that they cannot be instantiated directly and must be implemented. When we decide on a type of entity by its behaviour and not via attribute we should define it as an interface.

interface InterfaceName {
    // Constant fields (public static final by default)  
    int CONSTANT = 10;  
    // Abstract method (public abstract by default)  
    void methodName();  
    // Default method (JDK 8+)  
    default void defaultMethod() {  
        System.out.println("Default implementation");  
    }  
    // Static method (JDK 8+)  
    static void staticMethod() {  
        System.out.println("Static method in interface");  
    }  
    // Private method (JDK 9+)  
    private void privateMethod() {  
        System.out.println("Private helper method");  
    }  
}

Note: 

Private methods can only be called inside default or static methods in the interface, not by implementing classes
Static methods are also accessible via the3interface itself not through objects

Great question! Let’s break down what it means when we say:

> **"Interfaces support loose coupling because classes depend on behavior, not implementation."**

---

### 🔧 **What is Loose Coupling?**

**Loose coupling** means that parts of your code (like classes) are **not tightly connected** to each other. This makes your code:

- Easier to change
- Easier to test
- More flexible and reusable

---

### 🧩 **How Interfaces Help**

Interfaces define **what** a class should do, not **how** it does it. So, when a class depends on an interface, it only cares about the **method names**, not the actual code inside.

---

### ✅ **Example**

```java
interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

class UpiPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using UPI");
    }
}

class Checkout {
    private Payment payment;

    public Checkout(Payment payment) {
        this.payment = payment;
    }

    public void processOrder(double amount) {
        payment.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

---

### 🔍 **What’s Happening Here?**

- `Checkout` class depends on the `Payment` **interface**, not on `CreditCardPayment` or `UpiPayment`.
- This means we can **easily switch** the payment method without changing the `Checkout` class.
- That’s **loose coupling** — `Checkout` depends on the **behavior** (`pay()` method), not the **implementation**.

---

### 🎯 **Benefits**

- You can add new payment types (like Wallet, NetBanking) without changing existing code.
- Makes testing easier (you can mock the `Payment` interface).
- Encourages clean, modular design.

---

Would you like a diagram or visual to help explain this in interviews?

In Java, when you declare variables in an **interface**, they are implicitly i.e, whether defined or not

- public – accessible from anywhere.
- static – belong to the interface itself, not to instances of classes that implement the interface.
- final – cannot be changed once assigned.

Here’s **why** this is the case:

1. **Interfaces define a contract, not behavior**
Interfaces are meant to define **what** a class should do, not **how** it does it. 
So, variables in interfaces are typically **constants** that help define shared values across implementations.

Example:
```java
interface Vehicle {
    int MAX_SPEED = 120; // implicitly public static final
}
```
This constant can be used by any class that implements `Vehicle`, but it can't be changed.

---

2. **Why `static`?**
Since interfaces can't have instance variables (they don't have constructors or state), any variable must belong to the interface itself. 
That’s why they are `static`.

### 3. **Why `final`?**
To ensure consistency across all implementations.
If a variable could be changed, it would break the idea of a shared constant.

### 4. **Why `public`?**
Interfaces are meant to be implemented by other classes, often in different packages. 
Making variables `public` ensures they are accessible wherever the interface is used.

### Summary:
Variables in interfaces are **constants** that define shared, unchangeable values.
Making them `public static final` by default enforces this design principle.




abstract methods in Interface

In Java, when you declare **abstract methods in an interface**, you **don’t need to specify any access modifiers**—they are automatically:

- **`public`**
- **`abstract`**

You **cannot use** other access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, or package-private (no modifier) for interface methods.

---

### ✅ **Allowed Modifier: `public`**

All interface methods are **implicitly public and abstract**, even if you don’t write those keywords.

```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // treated as public abstract
}
```

This is the same as writing:

```java
interface Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound();
}
```

---

### ❌ **Not Allowed Modifiers**

These will cause **compile-time errors**:

```java
interface Animal {
    private void makeSound();   // ❌ Error
    protected void makeSound(); // ❌ Error
    void makeSound();           // ✅ OK (implicitly public abstract)
}
```

---

### 🧠 Why Only `public`?

Because interfaces are meant to define a **contract** that other classes must follow. 
That contract must be **visible** to the implementing classes, which is why the methods must be `public`.

---
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Great follow-up! Let's compare how **variables in interfaces** differ from those in **abstract classes** in Java:

---

### 🔹 **1. Interface Variables**
- **Implicit Modifiers**: `public static final`
- **Meaning**: They are **constants**—shared, unchangeable values accessible globally.
- **Initialization**: Must be initialized at the point of declaration.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  interface Shape {
      int SIDES = 4; // public static final by default
  }
  ```

---

### 🔸 **2. Abstract Class Variables**
- **Modifiers**: Can be `private`, `protected`, `public`, `static`, `final`, or none.
- **Meaning**: Abstract classes can have **instance variables** (state), just like regular classes.
- **Initialization**: Can be initialized in constructors or directly.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  abstract class Shape {
      protected int sides; // instance variable
      public static final int MAX_SIDES = 10; // constant
  }
  ```

---

### ✅ **Key Differences**

| Feature                  | Interface                          | Abstract Class                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Variable Type            | Only constants                     | Constants and instance variables   |
| Modifiers Allowed        | Only `public static final`         | Any (`private`, `protected`, etc.) |
| Initialization           | Must be initialized immediately    | Can be initialized later           |
| Purpose                  | Define shared constants            | Define state and behavior          |

---

### 🧠 When to Use What?

- Use **interface variables** when you want to define **constants** shared across multiple unrelated classes.
- Use **abstract class variables** when you need to define **state** or **shared behavior** for a family of related classes.

Abstract class in java

An abstract class in Java is a class declared with the abstract keyword. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create an object of an abstract class. Abstract classes can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body, declared with abstract and ending with a semicolon) and concrete methods (methods with an implementation). [1, 2]  
Key characteristics and uses of abstract classes: 

• Cannot be instantiated: You cannot create objects directly from an abstract class. To use an abstract class, it must be inherited by another class (a subclass). 
• May contain abstract methods: These methods are declared without an implementation and must be provided with a body by any concrete (non-abstract) subclass. If a subclass does not implement all inherited abstract methods, it must also be declared abstract. 
• May contain concrete methods: Abstract classes can also have regular methods with full implementations, providing default behavior or common functionality for subclasses. 
• Constructors and static/final methods: Abstract classes can have constructors, static methods, and final methods. 
• Achieving Abstraction: Abstract classes are a core mechanism for achieving abstraction in Java, allowing you to define a common interface and shared functionality while deferring specific implementations to subclasses. This promotes code reusability and maintainability by enforcing a structure for related classes. 

Example: 
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    public abstract void animalSound();

    // Concrete method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
}

// Concrete subclass
class Pig extends Animal {
    // Implementation of the abstract method
    public void animalSound() {
        System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
        myPig.animalSound();
        myPig.sleep();
    }
}
