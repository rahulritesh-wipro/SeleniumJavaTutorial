What is a static member in Java?-----------------
> A static member (variable or method) belongs to the class rather than any specific instance.
It can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
we can create static memebers by using static access modifier

What is a static method?
A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
It can only access static variables and other static methods directly.

Can a static method access instance variables?
No, a static method cannot access instance variables directly because instance variables belong to an instance of the class.
to access instance members from static context, we need to create an object of the class where that instance member belongs to.

What is the purpose of the static block?
A static block is used for static initialization of a class. It runs only once when the class is loaded into memory.

What is an instance member in Java?
An instance member (variable or method) belongs to an instance of the class. 
Each instance of the class has its own copy of instance variables.
if we dont use static it becomes instance member.

What is an instance method?
An instance method belongs to an instance of the class and can access instance variables and other instance methods directly.

Can an instance method access static variables?
Yes, an instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.

What is the difference between static and instance members?
Static members belong to the class and are shared among all instances,
while instance members belong to individual instances of the class.


Explain Polymorphism in java?
Imagine you have a remote control that can work with different devices—like a TV, a DVD player, or even a sound system. You press the "play" button, and it does something different depending on what device it’s controlling: the TV might start a show, the DVD player spins a disc, and the sound system plays music. The same button ("play") behaves differently based on what it’s connected to. That’s the basic idea of polymorphism—it’s about one thing (like a method or action) taking on different forms depending on the situation.
In Java, polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming where a single action (like a method) can work differently depending on the object it’s dealing with. Here’s how it shows up in simple terms:

explain polymorphism in java in layman terms


Let’s break down polymorphism in Java in a simple, everyday way.

Imagine you have a remote control that can work with different devices—like a TV, a DVD player, or even a sound system. You press the "play" button, and it does something different depending on what device it’s controlling: the TV might start a show, the DVD player spins a disc, and the sound system plays music. The same button ("play") behaves differently based on what it’s connected to. That’s the basic idea of polymorphism—it’s about one thing (like a method or action) taking on different forms depending on the situation.

In Java, polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming where a single action (like a method) can work differently depending on the object it’s dealing with. Here’s how it shows up in simple terms:

Two Main Types of Polymorphism in Java:
Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):
Think of this like a chef who can make "soup" in different ways. You ask for soup, but it could be tomato soup, chicken soup, or veggie soup depending on what ingredients you give him. The chef’s "makeSoup" skill adapts based on what you hand over.
In Java, this happens when you have multiple methods with the same name but different "ingredients" (parameters). For example:
class Chef {
    void makeSoup() {
        System.out.println("Plain soup");
    }
    void makeSoup(String ingredient) {
        System.out.println(ingredient + " soup");
    }
}

If you call makeSoup(), you get plain soup. If you call makeSoup("chicken"), you get chicken soup. The method name is the same, but the result changes based on the input.



2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):
Now imagine a family where everyone has their own way of saying "hello." The parent says "Hi there," the kid says "Yo!" and the grandparent says "Greetings!" When you tell someone in the family to "say hello," they respond in their own unique style.
In Java, this happens when a subclass (like the kid) provides its own version of a method that’s already in the parent class (like the parent). For example:


class Parent {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hi there");
    }
}
class Kid extends Parent {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Yo!");
    }
}

If you have a Parent reference pointing to a Kid object (like Parent person = new Kid();), and you call person.sayHello(), it says "Yo!" instead of "Hi there." The method called depends on the actual object, not just the reference type.
Why Is It Useful?
Polymorphism makes code flexible. You can write one piece of code that works with lots of different objects without needing to rewrite it for each one. It’s like having a universal remote—same button, different results.

Real Quick Example:

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myPet = new Dog(); // Could also be new Cat()
        myPet.sound(); // Outputs "Woof" if it’s a Dog, "Meow" if it’s a Cat
    }
}


Here, myPet.sound() behaves differently based on whether myPet is a Dog or a Cat, even though the reference type is Animal. That’s polymorphism in action!

So, in layman’s terms: polymorphism in Java is like a single instruction that adapts to do the right thing depending on what it’s working with—same name, different outcomes. Cool, right?
