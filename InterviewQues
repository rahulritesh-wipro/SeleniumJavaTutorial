What is a static member in Java?-----------------
> A static member (variable or method) belongs to the class rather than any specific instance.
It can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
we can create static memebers by using static access modifier

What is a static method?
A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
It can only access static variables and other static methods directly.

Can a static method access instance variables?
No, a static method cannot access instance variables directly because instance variables belong to an instance of the class.
to access instance members from static context, we need to create an object of the class where that instance member belongs to.

What is the purpose of the static block?
A static block is used for static initialization of a class. It runs only once when the class is loaded into memory.

What is an instance member in Java?
An instance member (variable or method) belongs to an instance of the class. 
Each instance of the class has its own copy of instance variables.
if we dont use static it becomes instance member.

What is an instance method?
An instance method belongs to an instance of the class and can access instance variables and other instance methods directly.

Can an instance method access static variables?
Yes, an instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.

What is the difference between static and instance members?
Static members belong to the class and are shared among all instances,
while instance members belong to individual instances of the class.
