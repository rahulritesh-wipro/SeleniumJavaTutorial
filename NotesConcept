Selenium WebDriver Commands

Explain the below commands-
java concept - Runtime polymorphism, typecasting + Inheritance
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()

explaination- if we are using ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); then 
here we have created a ChromeDriver() instance, this instance will only be able to invoke ChromeDriver class methods which is supported by google chrome
We should write code in generic way so that it should be compatible with all the supported browsers.
Here we need to create an instance of other browser again for all the code to work in other browser, which is not standard.
FirefoxDriver driver =  new FirefoxDriver();
InternetExplorerDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();

Hence here comes the solution
WebDriver Interface
From Selenium perspective, the WebDriver Interface is similar like a agreement which the 3rd party Browser Vendors like firefox, google-chrome, internet-explorer, safari, etc have to adhere and implement the same. This would in-turn help the end-users to use the exposed APIs to write a common code and implement the functionalities across all the available Browsers without any change.

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
Using WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); you are creating an instance of the WebDriver interface and casting it to ChromeDriver Class. All the browser drivers like FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, InternetExplorerDriver, PhantomJSDriver, SafariDriver etc implemented the WebDriver interface (actually the RemoteWebDriver class implements WebDriver Interface and the Browser Drivers extends RemoteWebDriver). So if we use WebDriver driver, then we can use the already initialized driver (as common object variable) for all browsers we want to automate e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, InternetExplorer, PhantomJS, Safari.


explain- method Chaining
driver.manage().window().maximize
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
driver.navigate().to();

Explaination-
method Chaining - java
In Java, method chaining is the chain of methods being called one after another. 
It is the same as constructor chaining but the only difference is of method and constructor. 
Method chaining in Java is a common syntax to invoke multiple methods calls in OOPs.
Each method in chaining returns an object.
It violates the need for intermediate variables. 
In other words, the method chaining can be defined as if we have an object and we call methods on that object one after another is called method chaining.

Syntax:

obj.method1().method2().method3();  
In the above statement, we have an object (obj) and calling method1() then method2(), after that the method3(). So, calling or invoking methods one after another is known as method chaining.

package com.TestSelenium.KT.Sessions;

class Windows {

	public void maximize() {
		System.out.println("maximize() method is called");
		System.out.println("browser is maximized");

	}

}

class Options {

	public Windows window() {
		System.out.println("window() method is called");
		return new Windows();
	}

}

public class MethodChainingConcept {

	public Options manage() {
		System.out.println("manage() method is called");
		return new Options();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		MethodChainingConcept driver = new MethodChainingConcept();
		Options option = driver.manage();
		Windows window = option.window();
		window.maximize();

		driver.manage().window().maximize();

	}

}


There is a method named “manage()” and declared In WebDriver interface. The return type of this method is Options. The Options interface is a subinterface of WebDriver interface. The Options interface has a method “window()” that returns an Interface type Window and that is also a subinterface of WebDriver interface. The Window interface has a method “maximize()” that returns void.
By following the above coding approach you need to write multiple lines of code as below –
WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
Options optnObj= driver.manage();
Window winObj= optnObj.window();
winObj.maximize();

And if we follow method chaining then it can be written in fewer lines as –

See complete code below:

WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
driver.manage().window().maximize();







explain
driver.get();
driver.findElement();
driver.findElements();
driver.close();
driver.quite();
driver.getCurrentUrl();
driver.getPageSource();
driver.getPageTitle
();
driver.getWindowHandle();
driver.getWindowHandles();

driver.switchTo();
